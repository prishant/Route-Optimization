# Route-Optimization

– Developed a website implementing route optimization algorithms that cater to customers to determine the route and schedule buses depending on constraints such as time window, fuel and operational cost and traffic simulation.

– Worked on metaheuristic models based on Tabu Search, and Genetic Algorithm.
  
## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Route Optimization which is based on Genetic Algotrithm and Tabu Search in order to find the best possible paths in order to pickup employees in certain time window.
 
 - Given number of buses, passenger and bus stop locations. Develop a route optimization algorithm to determine route and schedule of buses subject to the provided constraints.
 - System should cater to the real time changing demand of employees
 - Both pickup and drop routes should be generated
 - Heterogeneous Fleet of buses are considered

## Objective

 - Minimize Operational Cost 
 - Fuel cost is the dominant factor
 - Best measured by time 

## Constraints

 - Number of Buses (hard) 
 - Bus Capacity (heterogeneous fleet, hard)  
 - Time window to reach office (hard)
 - Time Window created using employee’s time windows (both hard and soft)
 - Maximum Riding Time (hard) 
 - Minimum Occupancy (both hard and soft)
